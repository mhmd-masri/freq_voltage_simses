Introduction
========================================

SimSES (Simulation of stationary energy storage systems) is an open source modeling framework for
simulating stationary energy storage systems. The tool, initially developed in MATLAB by Maik Naumann and
Nam Truong, was 2019 converted to Python and improved by Marc Moeller and Daniel Kucevic at the
Institute for Electrical Energy Storage Technology - Technical University Munich.

SimSES enables a detailed simulation and evaluation of stationary energy storage systems with the current main focus on
lithium-ion batteries. Future releases will include redox-flow batteries and Power-to-Gas systems.
The main component of the modular and flexible software-tool is an abstract approach to the
energy storage model, which allows the variation and hybridization of storage technologies and technical sub-components.
Furthermore, stress characterization enables the estimation of the energy storage degradation.
Various aging models can be used for this purpose, whereby detailed models based on aging
experiments especially for batteries had been developed at the Institute.
In order to optimize the utilization of the energy storage in the different applications,
a large number of operating strategies are implemented.
Time series simulations and built-in evaluations allow to calculate and monitor technical parameters for
simulated storage operation. Furthermore, technical and economic key performance indicators (characteristics)
are derived and enable the assessment and comparison of the simulation results.

The tool has been used for several publications, including the following papers:
